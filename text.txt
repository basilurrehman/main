In need of someone to build an automation between Stripe and HubSpot: 1. When a subscription is purchased via Stripe (see https://buy.stripe.com/7sI8yPcBt1SScuc144), find and update or create a contact in HubSpot. Carry over email, first name, last name, type of business and company name to the contact. Update the contact's Membership Status field to Active. (Contacts must be allowed to re-enroll in the workflow as subscriptions can be cancelled and then bought again.) 2. Create a new associated deal, in the Closed Won stage. Carry over date and amount from Stripe and create a name for the deal. 3. When a subscription is cancelled in Stripe (via the enabled customer portal), find that contact in HubSpot and update the Membership Status field to Cancelled. This is what we believe we want, but I'd like to conduct a bit of discovery in order to make sure we're not missing anything - and with a view to the future. (For example, while we're only selling one subscription plan today, in the future we may be selling multiple subscriptions at different prices, and would want the deal amount and name to reflect this.)

I need an expert who can conduct a prompt injection audit, and then recommended fixes, on our custom RAG chatbot (/ custom GPT/ ). We already have some basic prompt injection prevention and analytics in place -- but I want this to be more comprehensive. # TECH 1. Make sure you are covering all the most common prompt injection attack points. This is a publicly facing RAG chatbot. We need to protect against: direct (user explicitly crafting harmful prompts) and indirect prompt injection attacks (e.g., via third-party sources or multi-turn conversations). 2. The goal is make sure that the data (from the RAG) and custom instructions are NOT leaked. Please consider chain-of-thought or multi-step exploits. 3. I am fine with using available frameworks and attack vectors -- like this one (but you are free to suggest other options or even software that would do this audit) : https://www.facebook.com/groups/aipromptsforentrepreneurs/posts/1157578055650417/ 4. Besides data and system instruction leakage, do consider these 5 vectors: Prompt hijacking (attacker gaining control over bot behavior) Indirect manipulation (chain-of-thought or multi-step exploits) Jailbreaking (forcing the chatbot to act against its programmed constraints) Confidentiality breaches (private or business-sensitive information) Integrity and misinformation (bot providing false but plausible information) # DELIVERABLE 1. Audit results (in spreadsheet) with all the injection vectors and responses. 2. Recommended prompts to fix the problems. # TEST OF SUCCESS 1. After fixing the problems, the audit should pass. # BUDGET 1. I've put this as a  fixed project based on my estimate of 6-10 hours. If you think otherwise, please DO NOT bid. 2. Ideally, you have lots of experience in prompt injection -- saving time on doing this project. # FUTURE WORK 1.This can become a full-time opportunity -- we have a ton of projects going on in parallel (see my Upwork profile)
I'd like to duplicate this website (https://vesperra.com) on my Shopify store.
Project Overview The software is a SaaS platform for video and avatar creation in Hebrew, inspired by Heygen and Synthesia. It focuses on perfect lip-syncing 100% and user-generated voices only (no generic voices). Core Features 1. Adding Products to Creator‚Äôs Video The creator uploads a video. The system detects the hand or environment and places the product naturally (in hand, on a table, etc.). Goal: Allow creators to review products without physically receiving them. Example https://www.topview.ai/?via=HubJam 2. Personal Avatar Creation The creator uploads a short video with their voice. The system recognizes the unique voice. The creator selects templates (office, beach, etc.). They type text, and the avatar speaks it with perfect lip-sync. Speech length limit: 1 minute. Example :https://www.heygen.com/ https://elevenlabs.io/ 3. Using Generic Avatars Hundreds of digital avatars (ages 18-60+). Various scenarios (influencers, professionals, etc.). Users upload their voices (no generic voices allowed). Lip-sync technology adapts voices perfectly to avatars. Exampple: https://www.synthesia.io/ 4. Subscription-Based Pricing Model Token-based usage: Example: 10 videos = 20 tokens. Price varies by token package. Anyone who leaves details will leave details only after they know for sure that they can do this project successfully, and also not ask me what methods of action to use - I am not a programmer, you as mechanics need to understand how to do it in the best possible way. I would be happy to receive a price quote for each message you leave. Thank you

I am building a react frontend to analyze the audio being shared to the website. https://imgur.com/icuxhO7 Basically there is a webpage with several components, and the audio track should flow from 1 to to the other, with the edits being applied at a given step NOT editing the audio track/nodes/refs BEFORE them, but persisting in the track/node/ref being passed to the one after. The issue I have is that while I managed to edit the GAIN of the track being passed to the first element (the Info Pane to the left of the image), I can't get the MODIFIED audio to go in the Quadrant1: thar volume meter in Quadrant 1 should become 0 if the volume control in the info pane is 0 -- and this should happen by actually modifying the track/node.. NOT by multiplying the VOlume COntrol number. And at the same time, the original Volume Meter at the top of the Info Pane should not Change. Then when I actually build Quadrant1 to apply some effects or stuff, the output should flow in Quadrant2, and so on. OUR GOAL: to build the working shell with the changes applied in one quadrant to persist in the next quadrant, and so on. In each quadrant add a Lowpass and Highpass filter button and a visualizer of the EQ Bars of the inouts/outputs of that quadrant.

Project Description: SEBCO Real Estate Website Bug Fixes & Optimization I have a real estate management website built using V0 and deployed on Vercel for my company, SEBCO. The website allows users to manage properties, tenants, and utilities with an interactive map-based interface. However, there are persistent bugs that need to be addressed to ensure smooth functionality. The website includes: üìç Interactive Property Map ‚Äì Users can click on properties to view details. üè† Property Management Dashboard ‚Äì Easily add, remove, and update property details. üë• Tenant Management System ‚Äì Tracks tenant information, rent status, and overdue payments. üîå Utilities & Suppliers Tracking ‚Äì Combines property utilities and suppliers into one section. Current Issues: Despite the core features working, I am experiencing several issues that are affecting the usability of the website: Login Bug ‚Äì After logging in, a persistent error appears (not sure if it's session-related or a redirect issue). Chrome Performance Issues ‚Äì The site does not run smoothly on Google Chrome, sometimes failing to load certain elements. CORS & HTTPS Errors ‚Äì Some requests are blocked, likely due to API or Vercel settings. Map Feature Optimization ‚Äì Need to improve real estate market data visualization (vacancy rates, property value trends). Database Syncing Issues ‚Äì Changes (like tenant updates) sometimes do not reflect instantly. Slow Loading & API Rate Limits ‚Äì Optimize caching and request handling to improve performance. Goals for this Project: ‚úÖ Fix the login error and ensure smooth authentication (if needed). ‚úÖ Ensure the website functions properly on Chrome with no performance issues. ‚úÖ Fix CORS, HTTPS, and API request issues to prevent blocked data. ‚úÖ Improve the interactive property map so it displays accurate real estate trends. ‚úÖ Ensure real-time updates for tenants, properties, and utilities. ‚úÖ Deploy final fixes on Vercel and test the site thoroughly. I am looking for an experienced V0 & Vercel developer who can identify these issues, debug them efficiently, and optimize the website. If you have expertise in V0, JavaScript (React or Next.js), APIs, and deployment troubleshooting, I‚Äôd love to work with you! üöÄ

Description: We're looking for a talented designer to create visual materials and a clear demonstration (preferably video or animation format) of a simplified casino-themed / slot/  style game, which our developers can implement using our own branding and mascot. The game should closely match the mechanics and style of the provided example video: https://youtu.be/Y5r2Zmg56fc?si=VVkJYkd_U4DSjJmv&t=239 Game Overview: The game has two main phases: 1. A random draw selects a winner‚Äôs username from a provided list. 2. The winner participates in an interactive, visually engaging slot-type game where they choose whether to risk their current winnings for a chance to win a larger prize. Each subsequent choice increases potential rewards but also adds risk by converting previously won prize segments into / no win/  sectors. The design and flow need to clearly illustrate game mechanics, interaction points, and visual appeal for a live-streamed experience, closely following the example provided. Deliverables: - All necessary graphic assets to enable our developers to build the game (UI elements, slot graphics, mascot, prize visuals, etc.). - A demonstration (video or other suitable format) clearly showing the game flow, transitions, user interactions, and overall game dynamics. Optional (preferred, not required): - Ability to assist or at least guide our developers through the integration process of the graphics and game mechanics into our existing systems. Please include examples of similar interactive or casino-themed projects you‚Äôve designed. We're open to your creative input and suggestions, but the provided video serves as the primary reference point for the desired outcome. Looking forward to your proposals!

Go to Gsheet to read description: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13R6BSCgxMlORPkb1c9gGMvSZg04Mma4s9m9I_5RnSHQ/edit?usp=sharing The app should work strictly with gsheets, and the associated apps script. Nothing else to make it work. Here is a brief summary of task: 1. Create a google apps script function that implements Start Random Bot Trades. It takes 3 Parameters, Min and Max. It selects a random whole number inbetween min and max, and trade token. Then it selects wallets from the wallets given based on their percentage frequency % and places 1 trade per the wallet selected by it's / trade percentage of holdings/ . and it does this the amount of times of the random whole number. Avoid using dependencies 2. Creat a google apps script function that implements Start Batch Send Instant, to all the addresses. It takes all the parameters from the sheet called Batch Send Tokens. Also Create a differnt version of batch send that Send tokens to a randomly selected number of wallets. The randomly selected number of wallets should be in between the min and max parameters. This needs to be a separate function from Start Batch Send Instant 3. For all other information : Use cell formulas (do not use app script for this) to pull information for the information of the wallet info, you can reference the tab: / Example Data Pull/  to see an example for another use case, if a cell is green a user should input data there, if a cell is white then it should automatically have data filled in via a function , The / Refresh/  Rows buttons are there in anticipation that the api calls may be too much so to limit calls.

Hello, I have an online store, https://beltbox.bg/ , and I want to create a step-by-step belt builder where customers can customize their belt through multiple stages, similar to Anson Belt - https://ansonbelt.com/products/complete-belts Belt Builder Functionality: 1. Choose Width: Two options: 3.2 cm and 3.5 cm 2. Choose Leather: Display all available leather colors and textures 3. Choose Buckle: Display all available buckle options 4.Preview the Final Product: A visualization of the selected belt with an / Add to Cart/  button 5. Select Packaging (after clicking / Add to Cart/ ): A pop-up offering two options: Box or Bag Additional Details: The configurator must dynamically update the product preview based on the selected options. I understand this requires a large number of product images, including separate images for leather straps, separate images for buckles, and final product combinations inside a box. The final design should be as visually appealing and user-friendly as the example from Anson Belt. Can you build this for me? How much would it cost? Will the design and functionality be as smooth and polished as Anson Belt‚Äôs configurator? Looking forward to your response! Best regards, Pavel

Hi there, Looking at creating an MVP for a game in Unity for PC. It will be a third person shooter. Please see GDD attached. (first draft) We will use already pre made assets and will need some from your side or I can buy. This could include, animations (could use mixamo), sound effects, special effects and so on. Weapons: https://www.fab.com/listings/059f81b1-85ec-482f-8133-3774f4341348 Character: https://www.fab.com/listings/e560a4c9-fab0-4e0d-9482-2e5b4006c69a Environment: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/red-rocks-306399 Enemy 1: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/crystal-golem-pack-1-313633 Enemy 2: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/golem-3620 Please note you will most likely have access to other assets, sounds and so on so these above are just ideas and can purchase (from me) and will need to be modelled and graphics will need to combine together for a well branded experience. The goal of this is to show investors to raise capital. Looking to complete most of this in 3-4 weeks period and if job well done could be ongoing work.
