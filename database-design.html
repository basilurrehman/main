     My name is Sébastien Chort, and I'm the host of The Chort Show, a Montreal-based comedy variety show. I like to think of it as a Canadian version of Conan on TBS! So far, we've amassed over 1.2 million views on YouTube, 4.5 million views on Instagram, and 2 million views on TikTok. I'm looking for a solid video editor with minimum 1-2 years of experience in long-form video editing to edit my show's episodes. Here are the details of the project: - Approximately 2 hours’ worth of footage to edit per episode - Final cut of 12-14-minute-long videos for the show’s channel - On average a 1-week turnaround time - Footage from 1 camera, with pre-synced audio - Pretty basic editing style and basic coloring - Very little motion graphics and overlays - Experience with Premiere Pro/Da Vinci Resolve desired Since The Chort Show is a comedy show, having previous experience editing comedy videos is definitely a huge plus! Having a solid sense of humor is essential as I would be giving you some creative freedom in the episode edit. My budget is not massive, but I'm willing to negotiate on the rate. We would be working on a per-episode rate, with a rate ranging from  350 -  450. Feel free to check out The Chort Show on social media to see our content, especially the show's full episodes on YouTube. This episode we shot with an 18th century reenactment group can give you a good idea of the show's format and editing style: https://youtu.be/rjgio04b1vU Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you soon!

     All or any individual of these you can provide (with your CA PE stamp at completion), plans attached below for ready reference. 1) Perform Siteline analysis for new driveway on Summit Road, I can provide photos of east and west summit road views from CA DOT for a1 and a2 from CA  Highway Design Manual  section 405.1 at required locations if helpful. 2) Design a driveway and approach on Summit road for CAL FIRE access with firetruck turnaround to support 75000 lb fire truck as required by CAL FIRE, (rural driveway B/4 and B/4A from https://roads.santaclaracounty.gov/do-business-us/county-standard-details-specifications-and-documents/section-b-standards) 3) grading plan (its a pretty flat lot) 4) Survey (I'm not a licensed Land Surveyer, I used my Emlid-equivalent Base/Rover GPS survey equipment for the plot with elevation markers) Each Requires a CA Professional License!

     Won't read any responses that look AI generated, copy-paste, or canned. If you put in effort to write a real message, I'll definitely get back with you! Long story short, just made this website, launched it today. Take a spin through it let me know what you think. I have no idea how to advertise. The website is: https://www.taxsaledata.com/ FYI only, what I'm curious to know: 1. How would you do it, how much would it cost? 2. What would the cost be between (1) your fee, and (2) ad spend. 3. How much would I need to spend before I know if this is going to be profitable or a bad idea to scrap?

     We've been using AWS SESfor almost 10 years with no issues, but recently we received the below email regarding our account and are not quite sure how to deal with if. We have 3 seeks to resolve, but we'd like to get it done ASAP. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ [CASE XXXXXXXXXXXXXX] Amazon SES Internal Review Period for AWS Account XXXXXXXXXXXXX Hello, There's an issue related to your Amazon SES account that requires your attention. This message contains more information about these issues, and some information that might help you resolve them. We only change your sending status in order to protect your reputation as a sender, and to ensure that other SES customers' ability to send email isn't impacted. We may pause your account's ability to send email so that you have time to address these issues. When you fix these issues, we'll restore your account's ability to send email. --------------------------------------------------------------------- IMPORTANT CHANGE IN YOUR SENDING STATUS --------------------------------------------------------------------- You're listed as the primary contact for AWS account XXXXXXXXXXXXX. We placed your SES account in the US East (Ohio) Region under review. You can still use this account to send email, but you should fully address the problems that led to your account being placed under review. If you don't address these issues by the end of the review period, we'll temporarily pause your account's ability to use SES to send email until you resolve these issues. --------------------------------------------------------------------- DETAILS --------------------------------------------------------------------- We recently performed a manual review of your account's email-sending practices. During our review, we identified characteristics that could cause email providers or anti-spam organizations to classify your messages as spam. The methods we use to make this decision are proprietary, so unfortunately we can't provide specific details. In general, we only perform manual reviews when our automated systems indicate that an account is sending unsolicited email. Please review your email-sending practices and procedures to determine the causes of this issue. Common factors that could cause this issue include, but aren't limited to, the following: - Messages that are flagged by commercial anti-spam filters - Message content that implies that the recipient didn't explicitly ask to receive this type of message from you - A mismatch between the branding in the messages and the sending email address - Messages that contain content that's commonly associated with unsolicited sending - Email-sending patterns that are associated with unsolicited sending - Sending from or linking to domains that have poor reputations with online reputation monitoring systems The actual cause of this issue might be a combination of these factors, or it might be something not listed here. You're responsible for determining the cause of the issue, and for developing a plan to fix it. You should begin your investigation by reviewing the items in this list, and by considering your current bounce and complaint rates. For more information about what to do if your account is under review or your account's ability to send email is paused, see our Enforcement FAQ at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/faqs-enforcement.html. You can also use the Enforcement Dashboard to monitor the bounce and complaint rates for your account. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitor-sender-reputation.html. If you're testing your system's ability to process bounce or complaint events, you should use the Amazon SES mailbox simulator. You can send email to the mailbox simulator without impacting the reputation metrics for your account. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-an-email-from-console.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT HAPPENS NEXT --------------------------------------------------------------------- If we don't hear back from you or if the problem hasn't been resolved within 28 days, we'll pause your ability to send email using Amazon SES in order to protect your reputation as a sender. --------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT YOU CAN DO --------------------------------------------------------------------- Resolving this type of issue usually involves making comprehensive changes to your email-sending practices, as opposed to making smaller technical adjustments. This type of issue is often caused by the following issues: - Unclear or inconsistent branding - A missing, broken, or hard-to-find unsubscribe link - Broken links - Message content that implies that the recipient didn't explicitly ask to receive the message

     Project Overview: We are Royal Copy House, a professional copywriting agency looking to refresh our brand identity with a prestigious, timeless, and modern logo redesign. Our current logo features a crown shape with bar graphs and the initials  RCH,  but we're seeking something more refined that better reflects our premium copywriting services. Current Logo Issues: - Too jagged and sharp-cornered - The scaling/bar graph element is confusing and doesn't clearly connect to copywriting - Doesn't effectively convey our premium service offering - Lacks the smooth, refined quality we're seeking What We Want: We're looking for a sophisticated logo that: - Conveys prestige, quality, and professionalism - Has smooth, flowing lines instead of sharp angles - Maintains a subtle reference to royalty/premium service - Feels timeless rather than trendy - Avoids copywriting clichés (NO typewriters, quills, or pens) - Has the elegance of high-end brands like Rolex or prestigious film studios - Clearly connects to our identity as a premium copywriting service Deliverables: - High-resolution files in multiple formats (AI, EPS, PDF, PNG, JPG) - Black version on white background - White version on black background - Full color version - Style guide with color codes, typography, and usage guidelines - Mockups showing the logo in real-world applications (business cards, website header, etc.) Timeline: We need this project completed within 1 week. About Us: Royal Copy House is a premium copywriting agency that helps brands elevate their messaging through expert writing. We serve clients who value quality and seek to position themselves as industry leaders through powerful communication. We look forward to working with a talented designer who can help us create a visual identity that truly represents our commitment to excellence. Here is the current logo: https://imgur.com/a/Sn7dWLr Start your application with RCH or it will be ignored.

     We are looking for an expert in X and Instagram ads. Our main goal is to gain followers. As a media buyer, I have run multiple ads but haven't found an effective way to gain followers through ads—no matter what I try, the cost per follower remains very high on both X and Instagram. We need someone who knows how to lower the cost of follower acquisition through ads. Our profiles are politically connected, which means most of our ads get rejected or don’t even show up. IMPORTANT!!!: Payment will only be made if the agreed KPIs are met—specifically, if the number of followers increases through the ads you create. If you do the work but we don't see good results, payment will not be made. Here are the links to our X and Instagram accounts: https://x.com/Sudan360podcast https://www.instagram.com/sudan_360podcast/

WING WEDNESDAYS - From 5pm - 500g for  14 - 1kg for  22 TACO Thursdays - Friday and Saturday - 3pm - 6pm -  6 Tacos Schnitty   Schmiddy Fridays - 12pm - 3pm - Chicken Schnitzel and Selected Beer The brewery is called Little Bang Brewing Company which is located in South Australia.

     Build an Automated Make.com Workflow to Parse Email Leads and Send to HubSpot Description: I’m looking for an experienced automation specialist to create a Make.com (formerly Integromat) workflow that will handle new form submissions from web3forms, parse the data from email, and then push those leads into HubSpot via the Forms API. Here’s what I need: Email Trigger: Configure Make.com to watch for incoming emails (Gmail or IMAP). Only process messages from a specific sender or subject (the web3forms notifications). Data Extraction: Parse the email body to extract the lead’s Name, Email, Phone, and Company. If the lead’s Name is a single field, map it to HubSpot’s  firstname  property. HubSpot Integration: Use an HTTP module to send the extracted data to HubSpot’s Forms API. Include my HubSpot Portal ID and Form GUID. Correctly map each field (e.g., firstname, email, phone, company). Validation   Error Handling: Handle cases where fields are missing or invalid. Provide clear logging and error notifications (e.g., via email or Slack). Optional: Logging   Alerts: Log each successful submission to a spreadsheet or database. Notify me if a submission fails, so I can address the issue promptly. Deliverables: A fully configured Make.com scenario that can be easily modified or expanded in the future. Brief documentation on how to maintain or update the scenario. Required Skills   Experience: Strong familiarity with Make.com (formerly Integromat). Experience parsing emails and handling structured data. Knowledge of the HubSpot Forms API. Ability to implement error handling and logging best practices. To Apply: Please share relevant examples of Make.com workflows you’ve built. Briefly outline how you would approach this project. Include your estimated timeline and cost. I look forward to working with you to streamline our lead management process!

     My name is Sébastien Chort, and I'm the host of The Chort Show, a Montreal-based comedy variety show. I like to think of it as a Canadian version of Conan on TBS! So far, we've amassed over 1.2 million views on YouTube, 4.5 million views on Instagram, and 2 million views on TikTok. I'm looking for a solid video editor with minimum 1-2 years of experience in long-form video editing to edit my show's episodes. Here are the details of the project: - Approximately 2 hours’ worth of footage to edit per episode - Final cut of 12-14-minute-long videos for the show’s channel - On average a 1-week turnaround time - Footage from 1 camera, with pre-synced audio - Pretty basic editing style and basic coloring - Very little motion graphics and overlays - Experience with Premiere Pro/Da Vinci Resolve desired - Based in Canada, ideally in Montreal Since The Chort Show is a comedy show, having previous experience editing comedy videos is definitely a huge plus! Having a solid sense of humor is essential as I would be giving you some creative freedom in the episode edit. My budget is not massive, but I'm willing to negotiate on the rate. We would be working on a per-episode rate, with a rate ranging from  350 -  450. Feel free to check out The Chort Show on social media to see our content, especially the show's full episodes on YouTube. This episode we shot with an 18th century reenactment group can give you a good idea of the show's format and editing style: https://youtu.be/rjgio04b1vU If you're interested, please contact me at: thechortshow (at) gmail dot com. Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you soon!

     Freelance Video Editor Needed – Create 100 Short Videos ( 30 USD per Video x 20 videos as a trial =  600 USD) I am looking for a skilled video editor to create 100 short videos, each approximately 20 seconds long, from my raw video footage. I am offering  30 USD per completed video. Project Overview ================= I have several hours of raw footage recorded by a professional cameraman, showcasing data recovery work in our office, involving hard drives, SSDs, mobile phones, and Apple MacBooks. The goal is to create engaging, high-quality short videos that highlight our expertise and services. These videos will be used for social media, including TikTok, YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Your Role ================= * Select and edit key moments from the raw footage to create engaging 20-second videos. * Ensure each video has a structured flow, such as: * Show our staff (human faces) * Show a damaged device (e.g., a broken hard drive) * Show our team actively working on the recovery process * Include an outro with our company logo and branding * Add background music and integrate voiceover files that I will provide. * Ensure our company branding is visible to prevent competitors from using our content (e.g., watermark/logo placement). * Do not use AI or automated tools—the videos should be thoughtfully edited for viewer engagement. * The videos should feel like mini-commercials, not just random clips cut from the footage. Technical Requirements ================= * Videos must be formatted for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn, and Instagram (vertical format preferred). * Final output should be high-quality and suitable for easy uploading. Access   Workflow ================= * You will receive Google Drive access to search through the raw footage to find interesting videos you can turn into something watchable. * You will need to watch and select compelling scenes, rather than just dividing long videos into random clips. * Develop a consistent style and process to maintain brand identity across all videos. If you have experience creating short-form, engaging content for social media and can work efficiently, I’d love to hear from you. Please provide examples of your previous work when applying. An Example of the type of video we would like: ======= https://www.tiktok.com/@payamdatarecovery/video/7265184358602968321 https://youtu.be/GnQ8fy15F0I?si=eNl8B70_fL9pakVI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL-XgQFXd4M

     I am looking for a talented freelancer to create engaging and educational LinkedIn and TikTok posts centered on AI tools that boost efficiency for family offices, investors, and business owners. My target audience is 30-50-year-old men who are eager to leverage AI to enhance their personal productivity or business operations. The core task is to scour the web for viral posts about AI tools that address the needs of this audience, adapt them into unique content, and post them on my social media accounts. The content should be versatile enough to suit both LinkedIn and TikTok. My key message is efficiency through AI. The purpose of these posts is to educate my audience about practical AI tools they can integrate into their tech stacks to save time, cut costs, and increase profitability. Ultimately, I aim to position myself as a consultant who advises on optimal tech stacks and builds custom AI automations for personal or business use. For example, family offices often prioritize cybersecurity. You might find a viral post about an AI-powered cybersecurity tool that combats advanced threats, then adapt it to explain how it protects the assets and data of investors or business owners—tailoring the tone and format for each platform. Responsibilities: - Research: Search the web for viral posts about AI tools relevant to family offices, investors, and business owners, focusing on tools that enhance efficiency. - Content Creation: Modify these posts to create unique, platform-specific content that highlights how AI tools save time, reduce costs, or improve productivity. - Platform Adaptation: Tailor content for LinkedIn (professional, informative) and TikTok (short, engaging, visually appealing), ensuring it resonates with my audience. - Messaging Consistency: Align all posts with my brand, emphasizing efficiency and positioning me as an AI consulting expert for tech stack optimization and custom automations. - Content Variety: Produce a mix of text-based posts, images, and short videos (especially for TikTok). Required Skills: - Strong research abilities to identify trending AI tools and viral social media content. - Excellent writing skills to craft compelling, educational, and audience-focused copy. - Familiarity with LinkedIn and TikTok, including their unique content formats and audience expectations. - Basic graphic design or video editing skills to create visuals or short videos. - Knowledge of AI tools and their practical applications in business, investment, or wealth management contexts. - Ability to understand and address the pain points of high-net-worth individuals and business owners. - Marketing savvy to ensure content reflects my brand and goals. Preferred Qualifications: - Experience creating content for financial, tech, or business-related industries. - Familiarity with family offices or wealth management. - A proven history of producing viral or highly engaging social media content. Application Instructions: Please submit: - A portfolio showcasing relevant work (especially social media content). - An example of how you’d adapt a viral post about an AI tool (e.g., an AI cybersecurity tool) for my audience on both LinkedIn and TikTok. Include a short description of your approach for each platform. Some examples of good content are these two profiles: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zainkahn?utm_source=share utm_campaign=share_via utm_content=profile utm_medium=ios_app https://www.linkedin.com/in/awaiskhanli/

     Skinny fat is a very popular term that is making the rounds on social media, etc. The latest science is revealing that skinny fat is unique tissue - thin fat and cellulite. The current online spiel is that poor diet, exercise, lifestyle causes muscle tissue loss and that lost muscle tissue turns into skinny fat. This is not how human tissue works. Muscle tissue cannot become any kind of fat tissue, or vice versa. No amount of diet/protein, exercise, or lifestyle magically turns skinny fat tissue into muscle tissue or gets rid of, prevents, or avoids skinny fat or the like. This is 100% not how human tissue works (there is no debate about this fact). People are desperate for real answers, yet are finding only inaccurate nonsense that helps no one. You can technically lose 100% of your white/yellow fat yet your skinny fat will remain. Regular fat and skinny fat are two different tissues. People everywhere are doing the hard work and losing their excess regular fat only to find that they are normal weight obese/skinny fat, all the while being told genetics are an excuse and they are just not working hard enough. Meanwhile, the obesity epidemic is raging out of control and forecast to get worse. Our cutting-edge science is the solution and leading the way. We want to discuss in short videos to accurately spread the latest science. #1 The latest science: https://skinnyfatscience.com/what-is-skinny-fat/?ref=1 Upwork_jp=9888 #2 Latest genetic body composition science, full summary: Scientific Body Type Quiz - https://scientificbodytypequiz.com/product/scientific-body-type-quiz-official/?ref=1 Upwork_jp=9888 Latest science that supports genetic body composition, Scientific Health Quizzes (Metabolism, Diet, Exercise, Lifestyle): https://scientifichealthquiz.com/shop/?ref=1 Upwork_jp=9888

     I need someone to completely manage getting website visits to my site. This will be through social media marketing. I need someone with experience getting Cannabis Ads approved with no issues at all. I need someone who can get me 150-250 website visits per day. These cannot be bots, they must be actual people and actual website visits. I need someone who understands they will not get paid if the ads are not approved or if they get rejected, or if they get no views at all. I am under the assumption you know exactly what you are doing and have no issue posting ads and getting visits. We have a full time designer ad ad creator on our staff so you will not have to create ads yourself, just be responsible for posting them and making sure they get views. If you are not confident you can get an average of 200 visits per day for me and have that number increase, please do not inquire about this post. www.dmvcanabisdelivery.com I need traffic from northern virginia, washington dc, and maryland. I will also need someone who is confident they can get me business nationwide. I have worked with a lot of ad people who have big promises but end up doing nothing, doing fake work with bots, or starting to do some work but falling off eventually. Again, please do not inquire unless you are confident you can do this. No excuses about Cannabis ads or any difficulties please.

I need to see an honest plan for getting us to page 1 rankings as fast as possible. Of course, I presume that you will be targeting the correct keywords based on precision of the search, likelihood of keyword to create a new lead and volume of searches. I also presume that you will find me some keywords that have been under-optimized by my competition where we can get some early wins. Please answer me the following questions so that I see that I am dealing with a human who actually read this job description and not an auto-responder that you fire out to everyone: 1. if you could only have 1 source for SEO insights (to learn about how SEO is developing week over week), what source would you choose? 2. what's the biggest change to happen to SEO in the last 24 months? 3. what's your SEO secret sauce that differentiates you from the other SEO experts in one sentence? Thanks for taking the time to read this. I look forward to hearing from you if it seems like your kind of client wrote this! Best David

     Hoi, ik ben Terence, video-editor, en ik zoek iemand die mij kan helpen met het maken van shorts. Ik werk veel aan 'pakketvideo’s': een hoofdvideo (vaak een 'werken bij'- of bedrijfsvideo), bijpassende advertenties en zoveel mogelijk shorts. Meestal krijg ik 1 tot 1,5 uur aan interviews aangeleverd, en ik zoek iemand die daar pakkende shorts uit kan knippen. Wat je van mij krijgt: een Premiere Pro-projectfile met alle bestanden, inclusief een gesyncte en gegrade sequence met interviews, en een sequence met voorgeselecteerde b-roll. Een deliverable ziet er ongeveer zo uit: https://f.io/JBtuV6MP. Ik zoek iemand voor een langetermijnsamenwerking. We beginnen met shorts, maar dit kan doorgroeien naar grotere opdrachten. Lijkt dit je wat? Stuur me een bericht, ik kijk er naar uit om samen toffe video’s te maken én samen geld verdienen :)

     We are attending a conference in Anaheim next week https://summit.aps.org/ and need and need to LIVE STREAM a panel conversation Tuesday morning from 8 to 10 am. We would want to live stream to (ideally all) LinkedIn, X and YouTube from our company account. One of my senior team members will be on site but he is not technically savvy. Hence, I need you to handle the recording, live streaming and audio. The conference venue does not allow a professional setups and we most likely will need to do this from a mobile device (hopefully with a tripod), no lights, a remote lapel mic. Generally, I you would act as an intern for our company and try to film it the best possible.

I’d like you to get creative on how to express emotion or with what you’re doing in the video. These videos will be used for text hooks. So imagine I put in your video with text that says  this is why you should be buying X, y, z  and then it cuts to a video of me explaining why you should be doing what the hook said. I hope that makes sense.

     I publish on YouTube what are called Design Battles. It's where I get 3 engineers together and give them a design where they each race against each other to finish it in the fastest time. We've done 5 of these so far using OBS. The tech was complex to setup, but we've worked through most of the issues, and I have a detailed procedure written out. It's complex because we need to record each participant's camera and screen share separately, each at 1080p resolution - and they need to be stored locally on each of their machines. We then edit all of these videos into a single HD video that we publish on YT. Simultaneously while recording they also need to stream out their camera and screen share as two separate streams so I can see what they are doing in real-time. This requires each participant have a fast computer, and the lag is too much on slower computers. In the past when I bring on a new participant - I've had to spend a lot of time on a Zoom call with them helping them get all of the tech set up, and confirming if their computer and internet connections are fast enough. I'd like to now outsource these tech setup calls to you. Then on the day of the event (recording) I'll need you on the call to facilitate each participant doing a quick test recording, and then just being in the background in case we have any tech issues. I plan on doing 1-2 of these battles per month initially. ONLY INTERESTED IN APPLICANTS FROM USA OR CANADA Here's one published battle for your reference: https://youtu.be/kA3WSC8qrfI

     We are designing the cover art for our upcoming holiday calendar product box. This is the 3rd year we are releasing an advent box, and we are looking for an artist to help us design the artwork. We are a hand-dyed yarn company that sells merino wool yarn in the US. The box will be a 24-day advent consisting of 24 skeins of yarn and some small gifts and notions. The theme for the box is  Winter Solstice . Concept: We’re looking for a winter watercolor-style folk art that celebrates the winter solstice, folk stories, ice princesses riding polar bears, woodland creatures that can talk, and frost faeries. All the magic of the winter season rolled into one beautiful piece of art. We will assign a color palette and will have a visual mood board to draw inspiration from: https://pin.it/7kq8wYEoc The box dimensions are not finalized, but we most likely will be around 8.5  x 5.5  x 13.5 . The box will have a front cover that opens, revealing 24 individual drawers inside. We are attaching photos of the Christmas Advent Box that we did last year so that you have an idea of the concept. We also like to incorporate elements of the artwork into products that we include in the box. Last year, we created some stitch markers and stickers. We would love to find someone who is willing to brainstorm on this idea. We have attached some art styles we like and are open to joining a Zoom call to discuss the project. Our deadline is to have artwork finished by early June. Please feel free to reach out with any questions. We do not have a fixed budget in mind, so please provide any rough estimates on cost and time.

     ✅ Join a  non-toxic  growth-oriented team, learn AI while earning, and get mentored by our CEO. Clay Bootcamp is a reputable brand that helps people change their careers by learning Clay.com and AI. We invest deeply in our students, and it shows in our testimonials: https://www.claybootcamp.com/#testimonials ✅ And here’s a video from Nathan Lippi, CEO/founder of Clay Bootcamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHu1p_h-Q4Y ✅ Why you might love this role: 👉 [Our CEO will mentor you, directly]: Report to and work closely with Nathan Lippi, our CEO, who will invest in your growth. 👉 [Break into AI]: Because we teach Clay+AI, you’ll be talking with people about it many times daily, and you’ll need to learn it. Your job can be an incredible forcing function progress. 👉 [Path to advancement]: Possibility to advance to AE. Our sales cycles are relatively short so the AE role is likely to be easier to break into than at other companies. Because we are a small company, the path to AE is possible but not certain – we’re still figuring out a lot as we go. Most of our team members progress to new roles as they grow, and you likely would be able to, too. 👉 [ Non-toxic  team and work environment]: The team generally enjoys working here and are growth-oriented and supportive. We treat people like people, not cogs in a machine. Team members often also take on Clay Bootcamp growth projects outside their normal job description, which keeps things fresh. 👉 [Wholesome sales role]: Your role is consultative, not pushy, typically talking with people who are bought into Clay and/or our bootcamp. Your job is to help us and them decide if the bootcamp is a good fit for them and their goals. 👉 [Structured Schedule]: Predictable schedule with clear expectations (primarily many 15-minute Zoom calls with interested prospects). 👉 [Impact]: Be the first touch point with a brand that is helping people change their careers and thus their lives. Help those who will benefit to move forward, and point those who are not a fit down a more fruitful path! ✅ You may be a good fit for this role if: - You actually care about people, are intrinsically motivated, and honest. - You are able to work EST hours. - People tend to see you as credible. - You speak English very well with no or minimal accent. - You’re detail oriented and mention your favorite restaurant in your reply. - You don’t mind many inbound calls in a day. Think 15 x 15m calls a day, which means some back-to-backs. The people tend to be already bought into Clay Bootcamp, so it’s not stressful like an outbound SDR job, but it’s still a lot of meetings 😊. - You’re interested in a healthy,  non-toxic ,  safe  work environment that values growth and collaboration. - For this role we care about raw talent and the qualities we mentioned above more than experience. - You are smart, curious, love learning things proactively (you’ll need to get to know the clay.com and agency space), and are mentally quick on your feet. ✅ A little more about the role: We’re looking for an inbound qualification specialist that can be the first touchpoint for the Clay Bootcamp brand – Nathan (the CEO) has a calendar full of admissions/qualification calls, and wants to free up that time to keep doubling down on improving the bootcamp experience. Your job would be to help qualify inbound inquiries, primarily on 15-minute Zoom calls but later perhaps more proactively with phone calls for speed to lead. This role is intentionally non-commissioned and instead has a higher base component, because this role is not so much about convincing people to join the bootcamp, it’s about working to ensure the great fits are identified, have any reasonable objections handled, and are passed through to a final call with Nathan. Those who are not a great fit should be politely pointed to resources that make sense to them. ✅ How to apply: 1. Send a less-than-1-minute video of yourself explaining why you think this role is a good mutual fit. 2. After that, we may ask you a few questions. 3. We may proceed to a _paid_ technical proficiency assessment. We’re very much looking forward to hearing from you 🎉.

     I would like a highly skilled person to create an AI video of me speaking to a large audience. I have already recorded and attached the audio. #1. First task would be to use audio editing to make this sound great and realistic as if it were being spoken in an auditorium. #2. Create AI video so that it is extremely realistic of me speaking this to a crowd. Ideal look of space, audience, and even camera angle is this: https://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-3501879533-celebrity-public-speaker-giving-inspiring-talk-international Or if it is way too difficult to match the lips and speaking it could be just a shot like this: https://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-3501881379-south-asian-speaker-welcoming-audience-he-goes #3. Add some good royalty free music in the background to enhance the feel. I don't know the process but I can feed AI clips of me speaking such as this one: https://vimeo.com/1026290334 **** if none of that works we could also consider: a. doing full audio edit but only do ai video for first and last 5 seconds. The middle will be all Broll.

     📌 Project Overview: We need an internal, ready-to-use temperature and location monitoring solution for refrigeration equipment, similar to Beyond Ice 3, but not a full commercial product. The system must: ✅ Use a PT1000 sensor (or another high-precision alternative suggested by the freelancer). ✅ Track the real-time location of the device. ✅ Transmit temperature and location data via Wi-Fi to a server. ✅ Display data in a client dashboard on a WordPress website. ✅ Include a notification system (Email or SMS) when the temperature exceeds normal limits. ✅ Be easy to install and configure by a service engineer on-site. ✅ Be a fully packaged internal solution, optimized for in-house use rather than mass production. ✅ Encourage freelancer’s initiative and suggestions for the best implementation. 🛠 What Needs to Be Done: 1️⃣ Selecting the Optimal Hardware - PT1000 or another high-accuracy sensor. - A microcontroller for data transmission (ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or another option). - A signal amplifier (MAX31865 or another module). - A GPS module (or alternative location tracking method). 2️⃣ Firmware Development for the Device - Reading temperature data from the PT1000 sensor. - Tracking and sending GPS location of the device. - Transmitting data via HTTP/MQTT/WebSocket (freelancer's choice). - Optimizing power consumption for stable operation. - Ensuring easy setup and configuration by a field engineer. - A waterproof enclosure for the controller. 3️⃣ Server-Side Development (API + Database) - Receiving and processing temperature and location data from the device. - Storing data in a database (MySQL, Firebase, or other solution). - Implementing a notification system for abnormal temperature readings. 4️⃣ Client Web Interface Development - Temperature graph (Chart.js / Recharts). - Historical temperature log. - Map integration to track device location. - WordPress integration (custom plugin or API connection). Main Requirements: The freelancer must deliver a fully packaged internal solution that is ready for immediate use. The installation and configuration process must be simple, allowing a field engineer to set it up easily. The system should be similar to Beyond Ice 3 (only temperature monitoring) in functionality but developed for internal use. Initiative is highly encouraged — we value suggestions for the best implementation approach. 🔹 Requirements for the Freelancer: ✅ Experience with PT1000 / RTD sensors. ✅ Knowledge of ESP32, Raspberry Pi, MAX31865, and GPS modules. ✅ Experience in IoT projects (Wi-Fi, MQTT, HTTP). ✅ Familiarity with server APIs and WordPress integration. ✅ Experience with location tracking and map integration. ✅ Ability to create an easy-to-use and deployable solution.

     I have been posting youtube videos for a few years now but I am starting a new channel and want the help of an editor from the beginning. The channel is in the productivity space but with an interesting twist. I will be writing the video, filming then sending you over the raw unedited video with the script and some notes. Video style: Talking head. Generally I don't like overly edited videos, ones with edits for the sake of edits. I want the edits to help provide clarity to the user about what is going on or add jokes. It will be a talking head video with B-roll or animations over it. Inspiration: -Ali Abdaal -Dan Koe Other styles we can experiment with -Fireship -Economics Explained Most important: Have a sense of humor. Preferably a younger editor as I am 26 but if you are funny and can express that through editing it doesn't matter how old you are. Schedule: - Long form video 2x per week. ~10mins in length - Shorts posted across all channels 4x per week. Shorts will be made from the longer videos This is my old channel: https://www.youtube.com/@Willysan The issue in the past was that the videos took too long to make.

     I need an expert in mobile, vpn and proxy networks who can help me setup a mobile proxy service where devices in other areas can login to my mobile hotspot to get a mobile IP read this for more details: To enable remote servers to access your hotspot, you need to configure port forwarding, static IP (or dynamic DNS), and firewall rules. The exact setup depends on the hotspot device and your carrier. ⸻ 1️⃣ Check Carrier Restrictions Some mobile carriers block inbound connections, preventing remote access. ✅ Check if your carrier: • Allows port forwarding • Provides a public IP address (Some use CGNAT, which blocks remote access) • If they block direct access, use VPN or reverse tunneling (see below). ⸻ 2️⃣ Enable Port Forwarding (If Supported) Many mobile hotspots (Netgear, Teltonika, Inseego, etc.) support port forwarding. How to Enable Port Forwarding on a Hotspot Router 1. Login to Router Admin Page • Open a browser and go to http://192.168.1.1 (or your router’s IP). • Enter admin credentials. 2. Find Port Forwarding Settings • Look under Advanced Settings → Port Forwarding / NAT. 3. Add a Port Forwarding Rule • Example settings: • Internal IP: 192.168.1.100 (device you want to expose) • External Port: 8080 (choose any open port) • Internal Port: 80 (or any port the service is running on) • Protocol: TCP 4. Save   Restart Router 🔹 Now, your server should be accessible via: http://[Your Public IP]:8080 📌 To check your public IP: https://www.whatismyip.com ⸻ 3️⃣ Handle Dynamic IPs (Use Dynamic DNS) Most ISPs change public IP addresses periodically. Use a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service like: ✅ Free DDNS providers: • No-IP • DynDNS • DuckDNS Steps to set up DDNS: 1. Register a free hostname (e.g., myhotspot.no-ip.com). 2. Configure DDNS in your router settings. 3. Use your DDNS hostname instead of your IP (http://myhotspot.no-ip.com:8080). ⸻ 4️⃣ Firewall Configuration (Open Ports) Some hotspot routers block incoming connections. Ensure your firewall allows remote access. For Netgear, Teltonika, Inseego Hotspots 1. Go to Firewall Settings (http://192.168.1.1) 2. Find Security / Firewall Rules. 3. Add an **Allow

     We are looking to hire a full-time Data Intake Specialist to help us work with home sellers across the U.S. This is a full-time role of 40 hours per week of consistent work for the long term. We are not just looking for a  worker  here. We are looking for a teammate. You will not be seen as a  contract,  but as a pillar of a purpose-driven business aimed at solving problems for home sellers that have been burdened with homes they don't want and/or are in financial distress. Every day, thousands of property owners search Google,  Sell my house fast For Cash.  Or,  Sell my house for cash As-Is.  These leads are sent to our company. We built a robust Machine to contact and keep in contact with these leads. Your job will be to run that Machine in accordance with the strict protocol we developed; returning calls, collecting property information, updating seller records, tagging data, setting follow-up dates, cross-referencing values on Zillow.com, etc. You will be working directly with Ian, our head of acquisitions, to best serve these property owners (Cash Offer Request Leads) at the highest level. All training is provided. We are HUGE on personal development and mastering our skills. You must be able to follow instructions. We have developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) around best practices. We use Airtable.com to manage our database   workflow processes, have our training in Facebook Workplace, and use Salesmsg.com (text   phone)   Gmail (email) to interact with sellers. There will be daily Zoom calls on weekdays at a specified time where you can get your questions answered on any part of what you’ll be doing. We're looking for someone who is extremely detailed orientated. This is not optional. It is required. You must have strong computer skills, too, with access to stable, high-speed internet. If that's not you, please do not apply. We're looking for someone with strong communication skills, who can play a pivotal role as a member of our team. You must be comfortable speaking on the phone, speaking with confidence, being assertive, taking control   being in charge of the process, and most of all, you'll need to be a good listener to the person on the other end to faster build trust   rapport. If that's not you, please do not apply for this position. We are looking for someone who finds joy in mastering a specific set of tasks each day   enjoys tracking their progress (gamifying their results) to see how effective they can become over time. If you're not internally competitive, meaning, you're interested in tracking your results   holding yourself accountable to faster grow your skills, please do not apply. We are looking for someone with high personal standards. Greatness is a Core Belief of ours. We only want to work with A-players, and you should only want to work with A-players, too. Lots of people don't like this kind of environment because it requires you to constantly level up your skills. But if you do, then we are interested in hearing more from you. LASTLY, we are looking for someone who is an obsessed learner, a capable leader, who wants greater responsibility in the future, where they'll train new hires on their position of Data Intake Specialist, which they have worked hard to master.

I'm open to different formats of content for the page. Could be slideshows like @mendatingadvice or you could be in the videos like this: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2bMAG2g/ You’d be warming up the TikTok account by spending two hours following people in the #mensdatingadvice niche / commenting on the videos you watch. Only following creators that are focused on providing dating advice to men. Then posting daily on that TikTok account for two weeks. As well as spending 10 minutes a day scrolling / commenting on videos on the @#mensdatingadvice niche. If the content performs we can do another contract.

     We are looking for a talented animator to create a 30-second animated YouTube commercial for our independent insurance agency, WHINS Insurance Agency, focused specifically on California car insurance. The video should follow a similar engaging and friendly approach to the script provided, highlighting the benefits of having a local Trusted Choice insurance agent. The video will link to a quoting platform to obtain an auto insurance quote. Here's a link to a reference video: https://www.loom.com/share/68370d96506e4f4d81f05d0803a77180?sid=5f65e6e9-ca0b-4d42-9c67-5e96a3f0f6b8 Here's a modified script idea from the aforementioned reference video: 0:00 Our Trusted Choice insurance agent is always nearby, ready to recommend coverage options if we decide on a new car—or two. Swing by, and we'll talk about your auto insurance, Laurie and Joe. 0:10 I like knowing my agent is close, especially if I ever need assistance after a little parking lot mishap—which I probably won't. Unless I forget that parking brake again. 0:19 I've got you covered, Tommy. I'm your local Trusted Choice independent insurance agent, and I'm here for all your auto insurance needs. 0:25 Trusted Choice. Local. Like you. Here's the link to the quoting platform our video will link to: https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/common/index.html?state=CA src=mercury agentcode=04C226 lob=auto I've included our agency's logo for incorporation into the animation. Our website link (www.whins.com) for reference and branding consistency. Your deliverables: A high-quality, animated MP4 video (H.264 codec) suitable for YouTube ads. Voiceover, background music, and sound effects consistent with a friendly, local, and trustworthy agency theme. Video optimized for clarity, engagement, and brand messaging for a California audience. Please include samples of similar projects or animations you've completed previously when applying.

You can omit the title of each section. Would this work for you and how much would you charge for this?

     We are looking for an expert 3D/Texture Artist who can deliver high-quality, low-poly vegetation assets. Our primary focus is converting our trees into a Civ 6-style aesthetic, with a strict tri budget of ~500. *Further details can be discussed. # What We Need: - Single-mesh trees – Foliage should be baked into the texture, not separate 3D elements. - Optimized, high-quality textures – Maintain a beautiful, stylized look with minimal geometry. - Exact style match to our Civ 6 reference (attached). - Convert our existing trees to match the Civ 6 style OR propose a plan for creating new ones. - Low-poly (~500 tris) – Maximum visual quality with minimal geometry for high performance. # What We’re Looking For: - Proven experience in low-poly 3D modeling and texturing. - Portfolio samples that showcase similar work. - A confident artist who can convince us they are the right fit. # Potential for More Work! If this project is successful, we would love to offer additional tasks to help transform our entire map into a beautiful yet highly performant world (optimized for mobile). If you believe you have the skills and can match our reference exactly, please apply with relevant examples of your work!

     Do you secretly think that you’re better than other people when it comes to planning, systematizing and executing? Do you glow with satisfaction, knowing that others rely on you to keep the engine running? Are you the kind of person who wants to take charge, but not BE the CEO? Then our Operations Manager role might just be for you. You’ll start by coming into the business and auditing our current systems, processes, tech stack and customer journey. From there, you’ll build out a roadmap on what we need to prioritise, based on the biggest constraints bottleneck us for hitting our goals Then, you’ll implement it all. From marketing to operations, onboarding to procedure optimization, you’ll take ownership. The result: Every person knows what they need to do, and when Our customers have a seamless experience Our stress levels drop and our sales/profits soar, because of all that you do behind the scenes We have big goals, and want you to help us achieve them. We are an online business that does strategic consulting, delivers online training, and creates a lot of content to do so. Behind the scenes, there’s a LOT that goes into keeping everything running smoothly. That’s where you come in. WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING Making Things Happen First and foremost, you’ll be the driving engine. You'll be the barometer that sets the pace and standards for our operational success - making sure the wheels are turning, the gears are smooth, and nothing falls through the cracks. From marketing to operations, onboarding to process optimization, you’ll have a hand in it all, keeping everything running like a well-oiled machine. A True Right-Hand to the CEO This isn’t a role for someone who just follows directions—it’s for a strategic thinker and doer. You’ll work alongside the CEO, tackling challenges together, making key decisions, and celebrating wins as a team. Your input will help shape the future of the business. Leading Change   Owning Operations (and Beyond!) You don’t just manage operations—you elevate them. You’ll set the bar high, build seamless systems, and ensure the team has everything they need to succeed. And as the company grows, so will your role—because we love people who step up and take charge. Speed, Efficiency   Getting Stuff Done (no compromise here) We move fast, and so do you. If you thrive in an environment where things get done before the coffee is even cool, you’ll fit right in. Use the word umbrella to jump to show you’re thorough. You’re the kind of person who sees what needs to be done and makes it happen—no hand-holding required. What You’ll Need: • A rare combination of energy, enthusiasm and execution skills. • Emotional intelligence that lets you understand and connect with people like a pro. • A brain that loves to tackle complex problems, can see problems before they even arise and has built out a solution before you’ve dunked that cookie into your morning coffee • Be a Data-Driven Decision Maker – You don’t guess. You use KPIs, tracking systems, and operational metrics to make every decision. • A deep understanding of marketing, operations, onboarding, and procedures. Your in depth knowledge of PM tools like Asana, is only outweighed by your love of CRM’s like Hubspot and HighLevel • The ability to work closely with the CEO, providing insights, bouncing back ideas, and driving the business forward. • Be able to give and receive direct feedback • Your working day must overlap at least 4 hours with Sydney Australia Who This Role is NOT for: 🚫 Corporate enterprise operators (We don’t need Fortune 500 experience, we are fast-moving, and agile.) 🚫 Agencies (We need hands-on execution, not consultants) 🚫 Generalists who don’t specialize in scaling online/digital businesses 🚫 People who need hand-holding or wait for instructions. 🚫 Managers who want to  maintain  instead of build, optimize, and scale. Perks   Benefits 💼 Full-time role 📚 Ongoing training and professional development. 🏡 Flexible remote work. 🎯 One-on-one coaching and mentorship with a renowned business growth strategist. 📖 Access to a bank of professional   personal development resources. 🚀 Opportunity to grow with a fast-scaling business. How to Apply To be considered for this role, submit the following: 1️⃣ Tell us your favorite store and why you love it. 2️⃣ A cover letter and PDF of your resume. 3️⃣ A screenshot of your results from this Enneagram test - https://www.truity.com/test/enneagram-personality-test (including your superpowers).

(why or why not?) - (hosted on YouTube, Loom, or Google Drive). Videos longer than two minutes will NOT be reviewed. 5️⃣ Tell us about a process/system you created: How you organized it. How you communicated it to your team. What challenges you faced and how you overcame them. 6️⃣ Your location and target annual salary (a range is fine). 📧 Send your application by 5pm Wed (AEDT) 19 March using the Subject line:  I Will Change Your Business.

     I’m looking for a designer to refine my brand identity for Royce Resolutions, a consulting and design firm specializing in AV, security, access control, and data cabling. I already have a branding kit (logo, colors, fonts) and need expert feedback on what works, what doesn’t, and how to refine it for consistency. What I Need Help With: Branding Touchup – Organizing elements cohesively. Email Signature – A refreshed, on-brand design. Social Media – Properly sized logos, banners, and Instagram templates. Patterns   Design Elements – Expanding on my existing branding (e.g., double r’s, rounded shapes, a custom arrow). Slide Deck Template – A professional, brand-aligned design. Website Design – Refining layout and visual consistency. Mockups – High-quality mockups for showcasing architectural drawings. Where Branding Stands: ✔ Logo – Keeping it unless a game-changing update is suggested. ✔ Colors – Pre-selected and aligned with the brand. ✔ Typography – Open to refinements, but only if they add real value. Reference Files: Branding guide and assets are available for review: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1woJ452VQemWXBXh3MJ-myMeMZVNBGejzxmKvZ3IdRB4/edit?usp=drivesdk

     Freelancer Instructions: Lead Generation for Eye Doctors Using Avastin in NY, WI, and FL We are looking for a comprehensive lead list of ophthalmologists and retina specialists in New York (NY), Wisconsin (WI), and Florida (FL) who prescribe or administer Avastin (bevacizumab) for intravitreal injections. This list will be used for targeted outreach, so accuracy and detail are crucial. Please follow these step-by-step instructions to gather the necessary data efficiently. Step 1: Identify Target Eye Doctors Focus on retina specialists and ophthalmologists who treat conditions requiring Avastin injections, such as macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion. Search for retina clinics and ophthalmology practices that mention intravitreal injections or Avastin. Step 2: Use Effective Search Terms To locate relevant doctors and clinics, perform searches using terms like:  Retina specialist near me in NY/WI/FL   Ophthalmologist treating macular degeneration in NY/WI/FL   Retina clinic offering Avastin injections NY/WI/FL   Intravitreal injection ophthalmologist NY/WI/FL  Step 3: Collect and Organize Data in an Excel File Use Excel to compile the lead list in a structured format. Create columns with the following details: Doctor’s Name Clinic/Hospital Name Specialty (Retina, Ophthalmology, etc.) Address (Street, City, State, ZIP Code) Phone Number Email Address (if available) Website URL Notes (e.g., if Avastin is explicitly mentioned on their website, if they belong to a retina group, etc.) Step 4: Use Reliable Data Sources Gather information from trusted medical directories, hospital listings, and review platforms such as: Google Search   Google Maps (manually visit clinic websites) American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) – www.aao.org American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) – www.asrs.org Zocdoc – www.zocdoc.com (search by specialty) Healthgrades – www.healthgrades.com RateMDs – www.ratemds.com LinkedIn (search for Retina Specialists or Ophthalmologists in target states) State Medical Boards (for licensed specialists in NY, WI, and FL) Hospital Directories (Check retina clinics within major hospital systems in target states) Yelp (Search ‘Retina Specialist near [City, State]’ for additional local listings) Step 5: Verify and Clean the Data Remove duplicate entries (many doctors appear in multiple directories). Confirm contact details (cross-check phone numbers, emails, and addresses). Ensure the doctor is actively practicing and offering intravitreal injections. Step 6: Deliver Final List Submit the Excel file in .xlsx format. Name the file as:  Avastin_Leads_NY_WI_FL_[Date].xlsx . Ensure at least 100 verified leads per state (minimum 300 total leads), prioritizing high-volume retina clinics. Step 7: Prioritization for Better Outreach Focus on larger retina groups and clinics that handle high patient volumes. Look for clinics that already mention Avastin on their website, as they are more likely to be interested. Include LinkedIn profiles when available for direct outreach.

     This video clip has particle effects coming out of the eye as the camera rotates. We need to create a seamless loop after the 7 second mark that continues for 20 seconds. You can edit the original video to add a few additional particles to help with the transition. It needs to be absolutely seamless so no one can tell this is added footage. The loop for 20s also has to be able to loop perfectly because when it hits the end the video will be programmed to replay at that moment. https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/1066038940/rendition/1080p/file.mp4?loc=external log_user=0 signature=d86af6881b73f6711be4c2e8bb3bb8452479932ab66583da2daaa687eaae1c61 user_id=130627073

Minimalist   Modern A simple monogram-style logo using  RE  (Rammed Earth) in a textured, natural finish. Clean typography with an earthy color palette (warm browns, ochres, muted greens). A sleek icon of a layered, compacted earth wall next to the brand name. 2. Natural   Earthy A logo incorporating a stylized rammed earth wall with visible striations. A hand-drawn or organic-style logo with natural elements like a tree or sun incorporated. A logo that visually represents sustainability with elements like leaves, water droplets, or a circular design symbolizing eco-friendliness. 3. Structural   Geometric A geometric icon that represents the formwork and compacted layers. A design that mimics the look of a cross-section of rammed earth walls with different layers of sediment. An icon that combines a house silhouette with a textured rammed earth finish. i don't want a circle

     We are looking for a highly skilled 3D artist to create lifelike, luxury product models of our premium aluminium suitcases. We have two sizes (Cabin   Check-in), but since the only difference is scale, the modelling should be relatively simple. The final result must be hyper-realistic, with perfect materials, lighting, and reflections to match our brand’s high-end aesthetic. We have attached a reference video showcasing the exact level of quality we need—your work must match or exceed this standard. Deliverables: 1. 3D Model of Both Suitcase Sizes • Highly detailed, realistic brushed aluminium finish • Correct materials for handles, zippers, and wheels • Accurate branding   logo placement 2. Cinematic Product Animation (5–8 Seconds) Like the Attached Video • A black studio environment with premium lighting • Slow, elegant camera movements showcasing key details • Smooth reflections   luxury-grade rendering • No extra effects—just a high-end product showcase Requirements: • Expert in 3D modelling   rendering (Blender, Maya, Cinema 4D, or similar) • Experience in luxury product visualization • Ability to match or exceed the quality of the reference video • Strong understanding of lighting, reflections, and realistic texturing • Must be able to deliver the first animation at the highest quality level Nice to Have: • Experience in high-end product cinematography • Ability to create future product animations with motion graphics • Understanding of luxury brand aesthetics Budget   Long-Term Collaboration: Right now, the budget is small, but we are a fast-growing, highly ambitious brand that is set to scale rapidly. This is an opportunity to get in at the ground level of a brand that is going places. We strongly encourage you to check out our Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/sapphiresuitcases/) to see the level of content we are creating and the high-end, luxury standard we maintain. If you look at our brand presence, you’ll see that we are serious, premium, and rapidly expanding. Additionally, our founder, Raph Watson (https://www.instagram.com/raphwatson/), has a background in filmmaking and storytelling. His creative vision ensures that our content is always high-quality, cinematic, and premium. This is a chance to collaborate closely with someone who understands 3D animation and values exceptional craft. This is not just a one-off job—we are looking to build a long-term relationship with a talented 3D artist. As the brand grows, we will be commissioning more 3D animations at increasingly higher budgets. Someone who works with us now will grow with us and be our go-to partner for high-end product visuals as we scale. If you’re looking for just another freelance gig, this might not be for you. But if you want to work with a fast-growing, high-end brand and be part of something bigger, exciting, and luxury-focused, this is your chance. Brand   Reference: Website: https://www.sapphiresuitcases.com Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sapphiresuitcases/ Founder’s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/raphwatson/ Application Requirements: Please apply with: 1. Your portfolio (especially luxury products) 2. A quote for the first video as a one-off payment 3. Confirmation that you can match or exceed the reference video quality We are not just looking for a freelancer—we are looking for a partner who can help us bring our luxury brand to life. If you have the skills, experience, and passion for high-end visuals, we’d love to hear from you!

     I'm going to film a birthday video. It's basically a trend using a candle to make it look like smoking. A candle can't make smoke and it would be interesting to add smoke because viewers will be like how since there's no way to blow smoke from the mouth from a candle. The smoke effect will only be a few seconds and must look very realistic. I may want to also make the lighter flame/torch look better but I haven't filmed the video yet. I'll have it ready this coming week. This is what I'm looking for: https://www.tiktok.com/@tabithaswatosh/video/7271491389815426350?is_from_webapp=1 sender_device=pc web_id=7427796272390702638 She may have used a vape or something else for the smoke or did it with effects. Mention if you have ideas and if you can do other cool effects show me. I will need to see what you can do and how you can do this.

     I'm looking for an experienced seamstress to produce six pairs of custom period underwear. For the capstone project of my BFA I have created a concept brand of period products for kids. I would like to transfrom my repeating patterns into prototypes of period underwear. Here are the specs: 1 pair of brief style underwear, size youth XS 1 pair of brief style underwear, size youth M 1 pair of brief style underwear, size adult M 1 pair of boxer brief style underwear, size youth XS 1 pair of boxer brief style underwear, size youth M 1 pair of boxer brief style underwear, size adult M I will supply a 1/2 yard of printed fabric for each pair of underwear. I will also supply the three different fabrics for the three-layer absorbent crotch. (More information here: https://sophiehines.com/products/mini-period-panty-sewing-kit-black). I will need you to supply elastic for the waistband as well as polyester thread. We can work together on the pattern design, I will need something a little bit custom to incorporate the small sizing as well as the absorbent crotch. This needs to be a fairly quick turnaround, I'm hoping for around two weeks from when you receive the fabric. Really looking forward to working with someone on this who is skilled and open to collaboration!

     Some audio files need to be chopped up into individual files with one audio file for each line spoken. Each original audio file has four conversations. Each conversation must be saved as it own file. Then, each line spoken by a male or female speaker must be cut up into individual lines for the animation software. The files must be named according to a particular naming convention. Each conversation has about 6 to 12 lines. There are multiple files. Each file must go through the same process. The following video shows how to do the job. The video tutorial is 5 min long. (link removed) The following attachment shows the original master file and a folder with the final output and naming convention. To apply for the job, please watch the attached and linked video (6min) and state the following: https://toddbeuckens.wistia.com/medias/k4fw2sg420 What is the basic task of the job? What are the three rules the contractor must follow? This is a very basic job, one that is a good start for people new to this platform. The audio only needs to be broken into individual files. The contractor must be responsible, have attention to details, and a fast delivery time. There will be multiple contractors, so slow contractors will have the contract ended promptly so more expedient contractors can finish the work. Each contractor can work in 2-hour blocks, so only two hours a day. Contractors could be given between 2 and 10 hours of work total. Successful contractors can get further work on the upcoming podcast project. Preference will be given to competitive bids and the starting times.

We want it to be visual and simplified...don't just copy and paste this into a flyer. ----------------- We're  99/month and  .025 per SMS and  .045 per MMS. No contracts and no additional fees.

     I am hosting a company contest where everyone does an excercise estimating the size of a financing project. It’s specific to our company. I want to make it fun - there are two winners and each gets a  100- bill. I want to make the announcement of the winner by this fun cheeky video. The company meeting is Tuesday - so need well before that. Again, its just supposed to be fun and I think an AI generated video is perfect. DEADLINE IS MONDAY MARCH 17. Here is the script created from chat gpt - its kind of perfect.: I am looking to make this into a movie. Accompanying this I have a few pictures of staff doing hte work that I can send separately and weave in. SCRIPT:  PACE Eligible Spend Estimator of the Universe  (Opening shot: Dramatic music plays. The camera slowly zooms in on a stage with a large, futuristic-looking screen. A host stands confidently in the center, holding a golden envelope. Bright spotlights sweep the room.) HOST:  Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you’ve all been waiting for… Tonight, we crown the champion of an elite, highly competitive, borderline legendary contest… The 2025 PACE Eligible Spend Estimator of the Universe!  (The crowd erupts in applause. Confetti cannons go off in the background.)  But before we reveal the winner, let’s break down this year’s challenge. Because, folks, this was no ordinary estimation. No, no, no. This was a true test of wits, intuition, and, dare I say, a little bit of luck.  (The screen behind the host lights up, displaying a project blueprint.) HOST:  The contestants faced a typical budget—at least, that’s what it looked like on the surface. But hidden within? Some spicy little details that could trip up even the most seasoned estimator. Let’s review, shall we?  (The screen switches to bullet points with key scope choices.) • Insulation. To the purists out there—yes, maybe some of it was interior insulation. But let’s be real, folks, you take the whole thing. Nine times out of ten, no one questions it. Insulation is insulation. • Appliances? Heck yeah! It’s a hotel. That means fixed equipment, which means it’s eligible. • Kitchen vent hood. A notorious energy-sucking monster. Luckily, they had a makeup air unit in the cost—grab it all. • Major mechanical trades? Elevator, plumbing, HVAC, electrical… Don’t let the details fool you. Just take the full spend. The only exception? Fire suppression. (The screen now shifts to show financial breakdowns.) HOST:  Now, onto soft costs. The total budget was  19.5 million. Of that…  • Hard Costs:  16.9 million • Soft Costs:  2.6 million  What does this mean for our eligible spend? Well, based on our calculations…  (pauses for suspense) • Hard Costs Eligible:  7.82 million • Soft Costs Eligible:  1.18 million • Grand Total:  9 million! (Dramatic sound effect. The audience gasps.) HOST:  Now, some of you may be thinking, ‘But wait… isn’t this all subjective?’ Well, my dear friends, let me let you in on a little secret… The answer was hidden in plain sight.  (The screen switches to show the RAMP platform.)  All week long, there’s been a project sitting in RAMP, recently created by the one and only Beau. The project? Manchester Hotel. The eligible scope?  9 million. The proof? Right here.  (The link to the project appears on screen.)  Which means… the real test wasn’t just about number crunching. It was about thinking like Beau. Would Beau use a calculator? No. Would he use Excel? Nope. He would use RAMP! And he did.  (The audience erupts in laughter and applause.) HOST:  Now, let’s talk winners. There were two contests: one for the new transaction team members who must master this skill for their careers, and one for everyone else.  (Drumroll starts.) HOST:  The winner of the Transaction Team Mini Contest is… Heather [hidden last name]!  (Cheering as Heather is spotlighted in the crowd.)  Heather came within  230,000 of the final answer. Incredible work!  (The drumroll intensifies.)  And now… the moment of truth. The winner of the overall contest, the person who came closest to the actual eligible spend without ever estimating a job before in his life… A man who normally crunches numbers for finance… Who has now officially beaten every estimator in the company… A living legend… BRADY [hidden last name]!  (The crowd goes wild. Spotlights swing to Brady, who is lifted onto shoulders in celebration.)  Brady came within  200,000 of the final answer. Unbelievable!  (Fireworks explode on screen.  We Are the Champions  starts playing.) HOST:  And with that, the 2025 PACE Eligible Spend Estimator of the Universe contest comes to a close. Congratulations to all who competed, and remember—when in doubt, just do it like Beau. Good night, everyone!  (The screen fades to black as the PACE logo appears, followed by a triumphant final burst of confetti.) [END SCENE]

     I need 3 thumbnails created for an upcoming Youtube nature documentary by March 20th. I'm looking for a designer with experience in creating Youtube thumbnails and a good sense of what works well on the platform. It's a brand new channel so my budget is limited, so it may be best suited for someone looking for more work experience or to build a resume. I am going to A/B test the thumbnails, so each one needs to be unique enough to make the A/B test effective. I have included a link to unpublished video, and link to a folder with visual assets that can be used for the thumbnails. If any one wants to mess around with asset and do a mock up to demonstrate your vision, that is helpful.

     I need a VA who can replicate this style - https://www.youtube.com/@johnnyharris I have a political documentary channel. Budget will be 30  for 1000 words. Please read this out so I can better asses how you'll sound like in my videos -  Democracy has nothing to do with voting, in fact, voting is anti democratic. Voting is plutocratic. A society run by the rich. A democracy is a government that serves the best interests of its people, the people having direct control isn’t necessary. Voting makes the people control the government, but if the rich control the people, who’s really in charge? (mocking voice  but my beliefs aren’t controlled by the rich, I’m a critical thinker! My beliefs come from my logical reasoning, intelligence, and philosophy! ) If that’s what you want to keep believing, click off, and keep watching the usual political brain rot on youtube.  Thanks!
