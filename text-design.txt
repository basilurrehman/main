My beliefs come from my logical reasoning, intelligence, and philosophy! ) If that‚Äôs what you want to keep believing, click off, and keep watching the usual political brain rot on youtube.  Thanks!

I need 3 thumbnails created for an upcoming Youtube nature documentary by March 20th. I'm looking for a designer with experience in creating Youtube thumbnails and a good sense of what works well on the platform. It's a brand new channel so my budget is limited, so it may be best suited for someone looking for more work experience or to build a resume. I am going to A/B test the thumbnails, so each one needs to be unique enough to make the A/B test effective. I have included a link to unpublished video, and link to a folder with visual assets that can be used for the thumbnails. If any one wants to mess around with asset and do a mock up to demonstrate your vision, that is helpful.

Are you experiencing skinny fat? The latest science is revealing that skinny fat is unique tissue and is different from typical regular white/yellow fat tissue. You can technically lose 100% of your regular white/yellow fat but your skinny fat will remain. People are desperate to understand their skinny fat but the misinformation and disinformation on social media is not helping. Share your unique genetic body composition story using the latest science.

Skinny fat is a very popular term that is making the rounds on social media, etc. The latest science is revealing that skinny fat is unique tissue - thin fat and cellulite. The current online spiel is that poor diet, exercise, lifestyle causes muscle tissue loss and that lost muscle tissue turns into skinny fat. This is not how human tissue works. Muscle tissue cannot become any kind of fat tissue, or vice versa. No amount of diet/protein, exercise, or lifestyle magically turns skinny fat tissue into muscle tissue or gets rid of, prevents, or avoids skinny fat or the like. This is 100% not how human tissue works (there is no debate about this fact). People are desperate for real answers, yet are finding only inaccurate nonsense that helps no one. You can technically lose 100% of your white/yellow fat yet your skinny fat will remain. Regular fat and skinny fat are two different tissues. People everywhere are doing the hard work and losing their excess regular fat only to find that they are normal weight obese/skinny fat, all the while being told genetics are an excuse and they are just not working hard enough. Meanwhile, the obesity epidemic is raging out of control and forecast to get worse. Our cutting-edge science is the solution and leading the way. We want to discuss in short videos to accurately spread the latest science. #1 The latest science: https://skinnyfatscience.com/what-is-skinny-fat/?ref=1&Upwork_jp=9888 #2 Latest genetic body composition science, full summary: Scientific Body Type Quiz - https://scientificbodytypequiz.com/product/scientific-body-type-quiz-official/?ref=1&Upwork_jp=9888 Latest science that supports genetic body composition, Scientific Health Quizzes (Metabolism, Diet, Exercise, Lifestyle): https://scientifichealthquiz.com/shop/?ref=1&Upwork_jp=9888

My name is Annie, and I've recently started my own online shop. I create designs with characters and quotes from everyone's favorite movies and TV shows, and sell them on products like shirts, mugs, stickers, etc. Lately my sales have stalled out because I always procrastinating on the social media aspect of the business. I love the art side and the admin side, but I've never been the best content creator. I'm looking to hire a social media manager to help me create a content calendar, stay on top of posting regularly to stick to that calendar, tell me what pictures/videos to take, help me make TikToks, stay on top of trends, etc. To give you an idea of time commitment, my goal is to create 1-2 designs per week, as well as a handful posts/pictures/videos for each design. I've also never hired a social media manager before, so this will be a big learning experience for me. Please check out my website and Instagram to get an idea for my content, and let me know what you think!

I want to make it fun - there are two winners and each gets a - bill. I want to make the announcement of the winner by this fun cheeky video. The company meeting is Tuesday - so need well before that. Again, its just supposed to be fun and I think an AI generated video is perfect. DEADLINE IS MONDAY MARCH 17. Here is the script created from chat gpt - its kind of perfect.: I am looking to make this into a movie. Accompanying this I have a few pictures of staff doing hte work that I can send separately and weave in. SCRIPT:  PACE Eligible Spend Estimator of the Universe  (Opening shot: Dramatic music plays. The camera slowly zooms in on a stage with a large, futuristic-looking screen. A host stands confidently in the center, holding a golden envelope. Bright spotlights sweep the room.) HOST:  Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you‚Äôve all been waiting for‚Ä¶ Tonight, we crown the champion of an elite, highly competitive, borderline legendary contest‚Ä¶ The 2025 PACE Eligible Spend Estimator of the Universe!  (The crowd erupts in applause. Confetti cannons go off in the background.)  But before we reveal the winner, let‚Äôs break down this year‚Äôs challenge. Because, folks, this was no ordinary estimation. No, no, no. This was a true test of wits, intuition, and, dare I say, a little bit of luck.  (The screen behind the host lights up, displaying a project blueprint.) HOST:  The contestants faced a typical budget‚Äîat least, that‚Äôs what it looked like on the surface. But hidden within? Some spicy little details that could trip up even the most seasoned estimator. Let‚Äôs review, shall we?  (The screen switches to bullet points with key scope choices.) ‚Ä¢ Insulation. To the purists out there‚Äîyes, maybe some of it was interior insulation. But let‚Äôs be real, folks, you take the whole thing. Nine times out of ten, no one questions it. Insulation is insulation. ‚Ä¢ Appliances? Heck yeah! It‚Äôs a hotel. That means fixed equipment, which means it‚Äôs eligible. ‚Ä¢ Kitchen vent hood. A notorious energy-sucking monster. Luckily, they had a makeup air unit in the cost‚Äîgrab it all. ‚Ä¢ Major mechanical trades? Elevator, plumbing, HVAC, electrical‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt let the details fool you. Just take the full spend. The only exception? Fire suppression. (The screen now shifts to show financial breakdowns.) HOST:  Now, onto soft costs. The total budget was .5 million. Of that‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¢ Hard Costs: .9 million ‚Ä¢ Soft Costs: .6 million  What does this mean for our eligible spend? Well, based on our calculations‚Ä¶  (pauses for suspense) ‚Ä¢ Hard Costs Eligible: .82 million ‚Ä¢ Soft Costs Eligible: .18 million ‚Ä¢ Grand Total:  million! (Dramatic sound effect. The audience gasps.) HOST:  Now, some of you may be thinking, ‚ÄòBut wait‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt this all subjective?‚Äô Well, my dear friends, let me let you in on a little secret‚Ä¶ The answer was hidden in plain sight.  (The screen switches to show the RAMP platform.)  All week long, there‚Äôs been a project sitting in RAMP, recently created by the one and only Beau. The project? Manchester Hotel. The eligible scope?  million. The proof? Right here.  (The link to the project appears on screen.)  Which means‚Ä¶ the real test wasn‚Äôt just about number crunching. It was about thinking like Beau. Would Beau use a calculator? No. Would he use Excel? Nope. He would use RAMP! And he did.  (The audience erupts in laughter and applause.) HOST:  Now, let‚Äôs talk winners. There were two contests: one for the new transaction team members who must master this skill for their careers, and one for everyone else.  (Drumroll starts.) HOST:  The winner of the Transaction Team Mini Contest is‚Ä¶ Heather [hidden last name]!  (Cheering as Heather is spotlighted in the crowd.)  Heather came within ,000 of the final answer. Incredible work!  (The drumroll intensifies.)  And now‚Ä¶ the moment of truth. The winner of the overall contest, the person who came closest to the actual eligible spend without ever estimating a job before in his life‚Ä¶ A man who normally crunches numbers for finance‚Ä¶ Who has now officially beaten every estimator in the company‚Ä¶ A living legend‚Ä¶ BRADY [hidden last name]!  (The crowd goes wild. Spotlights swing to Brady, who is lifted onto shoulders in celebration.)  Brady came within ,000 of the final answer. Unbelievable!  (Fireworks explode on screen.  We Are the Champions  starts playing.) HOST:  And with that, the 2025 PACE Eligible Spend Estimator of the Universe contest comes to a close. Congratulations to all who competed, and remember‚Äîwhen in doubt, just do it like Beau. Good night, everyone!  (The screen fades to black as the PACE logo appears, followed by a triumphant final burst of confetti.) [END SCENE]
